## Overview
Fraud detection is a critical issue in the financial domain, and this project focuses on building predictive models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. We use a dataset that includes features such as income, payment type, housing status, and customer age. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle class imbalance, and apply classification techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## Installation
To run the project, you need to install the required Python libraries. It has the complete code:


## Libraries used
imbalanced-learn  
pandas  
scikit-learn  

## Data Preprocessing
Categorical Variable Encoding: Columns like payment_type and housing_status are mapped to numerical values.  
Example: payment_type = {'AA': 0, 'AB': 1, 'AC': 2, 'AD': 3, 'AE': 4}  
Handling Missing Values: Ensure all missing data points are handled appropriately.  
SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to handle class imbalance in the dataset.  

## Modeling and Classification
The following machine learning models are implemented and compared:  

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees  
Random Forest  
Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
Each model is evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Results
Performance comparisons between models are made using various metrics. The model with the highest precision and recall is chosen as the final model for fraud detection.
